# Geenz's Unity3D Tools
Hello there!  These are a few nifty tools I’ve put together for Unity3D for various purposes.  None of these are particularly organized, and many of them are kind of spread about for a variety of different purposes.  There’s a few small shaders here and there, some tools I’ve put together for Unity to convert different textures, and so on.  It’s a bit of a grab bag of functionality!

If you find these tools useful, please consider a donation!  I do take time out of my day to put these things together, and make them available to everyone so any donations are always accepted.  Read the Donations section below for details.

All utilities and classes contained within are written in C#.  Shaders are written in Cg using whatever built-in functionality within Unity3D I consider usable for my needs.

## What’s Inside
There’s a couple of texture conversion utilities (most notably SSBump to Normal, Normal to SSBump,) that come in handy from time to time, and a couple of handy functions I’ve put together to help with converting between different spaces.  You’re free to use these functions for whatever you please, provided you conform to the LGPL (version 2.1) license.  I’ll see about putting some of these bits and bobs together for the Unity Asset Store sometime later that will be available for a very small convenience fee to those of you who enjoy the convenience the asset store provides.

There will eventually be a list here of what’s included with these tools, including useful classes, wizards, and other utilities.

## Can you make it do XYZ?
Feature requests are cool and all, but really, I work on these things in my free time and only when the need arises.  Some of these tools may not even be relevant to Unity3D, others may have been created for something I needed Unity to do.  Feature requests won’t necessarily be ignored as such, but I more than likely won’t place any priority on most of them.  Bug reports however, are always encouraged.  If you find problems within my code, even if it’s a suggestion on how to improve something, please by all means report them on GitHub’s issue tracker.  I’ll do my best to fix any issues people find.  I also accept pull requests!

## Documentation
These tools will have documentation available online via GitHub’s nifty pages feature.  A wiki is also available for people to contribute documentation to as well.

## License
Geenz’s Unity3D Tools are licensed under the LGPL Version 2.1 license.  What this means for you:

- You may use these utilities as-is for a commercial work without the need to relicense your own code
- You may compile or link your application with this code as needed, without needing to redistribute your own source code.
- You may make changes to this library, provided you redistribute your changes under the LGPL Version 2.1.

Not so keen on the terms of the LGPL?  Relicensing is open for discussion on a case by case basis.

## Warranty
As with all little open source projects like these, no warranty is provided with anything that goes into this library.  As such, everything is provided **AS-IS**, with no guarantee that it will function correctly on your computer.

## Donations
As stated above, I accept donations!  The more donations I receive from this little project, the more time I can justify spending on it.  All donations go towards the upkeep and development of this project, such as the implementation of features and bug fixes.
